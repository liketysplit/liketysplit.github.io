                <p>I am currently obtaining a Bachelors of Science in Computer Information Systems. I am a highly
                    motivated individual and I am enjoying the growth this opportunity has afforded me. Before going
                    back to school, I used the skills I learned from the U.S. Army to work in the IT industry as a
                    Support Technician. I decided to go back to school because I felt that I needed more out of a
                    career. I work well with a team, but I am also able to thrive on my own. I pride myself in my work
                    and my values. Every day I strive to better myself through learning something new.</p>

                <h6>IT Support Technician II</h6>
                <p>
                    I installed and maintained a wide variety of systems desktop and server alike.
                    I took support calls and created support tickets for over 500 users and 300 systems using BMC
                    TrackIT.
                    I maintained security groups within AD to ensure only the intended personnel could access network
                    resources. I managed accounts and computers in AD based on company policy.
                    I examined current systems and determined whether to upgrade them or to replace them for the most
                    cost effective solution; and maintained future viability of the device.
